This is a device folder for the MB501!

Currently, many things don't work.

Working:
- Touchscreen
- Keylayouts
- Sound
- Calls/RIL
- Sensors
- Torch
- Data

Not working:
- Camera/Video recording
- FM Radio
- GPS
- Videos (Partially; Falls back to software renderer)

Due to the nature of the phone, or my abilities :P several OTHER things must be added to YOUR AOSP workspace if you so wish to compile this:


1. Download the frameworks at this git and put them in YOUR folder.

2. Delete YOUR libaudio because it conflicts.

3. Go into hardware/libhardware_legacy/vibrator/vibrator.c 

   - CHANGE #define THE_DEVICE "blah blah" to '#define THE_DEVICE "/sys/class/vibrator/vibrator/enable"' (without outer quotes ('<--- that))
